        These action bar item IDs (menu item IDs) are defined here for
        programmatic use. Normally, IDs are created using the "@+id/foo"
        syntax, but since these IDs aren't created in menu XML, rather
        used for programmatically-instantiated action bar items, they
        are defined here.
